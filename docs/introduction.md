# Introduction to EMOS

## What is EMOS?

EMOS (Electronic Materials Optimization System) is a comprehensive web-based platform designed for materials scientists and researchers working in electronic materials research. It provides a unified interface to access multiple databases, utilize various generation algorithms, and apply prediction models for materials discovery and optimization.

## Key Concepts

### Information Units

EMOS is built around three core types of **Information Units**:

1. **Databases**: Access to multiple materials databases including ICSD, COD, OQMD, AFLOWLIB, Materials Project, Alexandria, NOMAD, and JARVIS
2. **Generators**: AI-powered materials generation tools including Mattergen, Gnome, Imatgen, Matgan, Molgan, and others
3. **Predictors**: Property prediction models such as Mattersim, M3gnet, Pfp, Deepmd, Synthnn, and Esen

### Features

**Features** are high-level workflows that combine multiple Information Units to solve specific research problems. They are organized into two main categories:

1. **Materials Exploration**: Tools for discovering, generating, and analyzing new materials
2. **Electronics Application**: Specialized features for electronic device development and optimization

## System Architecture

EMOS follows a modular architecture where:

- Each Information Unit has a standardized interface
- Features combine multiple Information Units to solve specific problems
- The system is designed for easy extension with new components
- All components follow factory patterns for registration and instantiation

## Core Workflow

The typical EMOS workflow follows these steps:

1. **Select a Feature**: Choose from Materials Exploration or Electronics Application categories
2. **Configure Information Units**: Select which databases, generators, and predictors to use
3. **Provide Inputs**: Enter the necessary parameters for your specific use case
4. **Execute and Analyze**: Run the feature and analyze the results

## Benefits

- **Unified Access**: Single interface to multiple tools and databases
- **Modular Design**: Easy to extend and customize
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: From basic material search to complex device optimization
- **Research-Focused**: Designed specifically for materials science workflows
- **Scalable**: Can handle both simple queries and complex multi-step workflows
