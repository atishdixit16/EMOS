## 🔧 Development

### Architecture Overview

EMOS uses a modular architecture with dynamic feature loading:

- **BaseFeature Class**: Foundation class providing common functionality for all features
- **Feature Inheritance**: Each feature extends BaseFeature with specialized implementations
- **Dynamic Loading**: Features are loaded on-demand using ES6 modules
- **Consistent Interface**: All features provide standardized input/output interfaces

### Feature Development

Each feature is a self-contained module with:

```javascript
class YourFeature extends BaseFeature {
    constructor() {
        super(id, 'Feature Name', 'Description');
    }
    
    createInputsHTML() {
        // Custom input interface
    }
    
    createOutputsHTML() {
        // Custom output interface  
    }
    
    async processFeature() {
        // Feature-specific logic
    }
    
    updateOutputs(results) {
        // Update UI with results
    }
}
```

### File Organization
- `index.html`: Main HTML structure with dynamic content areas
- `script.js`: Application logic, feature loading, and AI responses
- `styles.css`: Complete styling including responsive design and animations
- `Features/BaseFeature.js`: Base class with common utilities
- `Features/*/`: Individual feature implementations

### Key JavaScript Functions
- `loadFeatureModule()`: Dynamically loads and initializes features
- `showFeatureView()`: Displays feature-specific interface
- `showLLMView()`: Opens AI assistant chat
- `createGenericFeatureView()`: Fallback UI for error handling

### Styling Architecture
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout
- CSS custom properties for theming
- Modular component styles
- Responsive breakpoints
